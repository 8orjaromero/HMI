            <h3>Park of Aiete</h3>
            <p>Noble and majestic. This is the Aiete Park. Located on one of the hills that surround the city, it stands out for its impressive gardens and, of course, for its palace.</p>
            <p>Its walls witnessed the comings and goings of aristocratic figures such as Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Victoria of England, Queen María Cristina or Alfonso XIII, who chose the palace as their summer residence. It has recently been transformed into a cultural center brimming with creative activity.</p>

            <h3>Kursal casino</h3>
            <p>The Gran Kursal building was inaugurated on August 15, 1921 and is one of the great works of the city during the first quarter of a century. His image is configured as one of the best pictures of the playful, cosmopolitan city and an arrogant point that represents the San Sebastián de la Belle Epoque.</p>
            <p>Three years later, at midnight on October 31, 1924, the prohibition of gambling was decreed during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the casino closed its doors.</p>
            <p>The Gran Kursal, prohibited from gambling, resigned itself to being the provisional headquarters for various activities until, in 1972, the owner company agreed to demolish it.</p>
